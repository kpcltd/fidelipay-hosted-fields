Hosted Fields Example
=====================
Included within this example are two key files. 
Gateway.php - This is a copy of the standard gateway PHP SDK. This is used to create standard direct and hosted requests 
and is included for demonstration purposes only. 

index.php - This is an example of a fully functioning hosted field integration, capable of sending transactions to our
gateway and receiving back responses. It calls out to our hostedfields.js file.

Included is the foundation framework, but is in no way required. It was included to show compatibility with frameworks
and generally to make the example look nicer.
